### Research Description

In recent years, Machine Learning and AI technologies have made remarkable stridesâ€”particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor.ai, ChatGPT, JetBrains AI Assistant, Google Gemini, and many others. These models have found successful applications across various domains, including Software Engineering, where software repositories provide a rich archive of valuable data: source code, execution traces, version histories, mailing lists, and bug reports. This wealth of information reflects the evolution and status of software projects and has been leveraged by LLMs to build powerful tools that boost developer productivity, efficiency, and velocity.

Most recently, Transformer-based LLMs and other deep neural networks have been employed to tackle key challenges in Software Engineering, such as code generation, automated program repair, code summarization, structural code representations, and defect prediction.

At the [AISE Lab](https://malihehizadi.github.io/aise/), our research explores several topics at the intersection of AI and Software Engineering, including:

**Intelligent systems for software creation with large language models**: Exploring how generative technologies can support and transform key aspects of software development workflows across diverse contexts and coding tasks, including code generation, summarization, refactoring, and bug fixing.

**Trust, Transparency, and Model Behavior**: Investigating challenges around explainability, hallucination, memorization, and aligned behavior in learning-based systems as they integrate into developer-facing tools.

**Evaluating Generative Capabilities in Practice**: Developing strategies to assess evolving generative systems across tasks, time, and toolchains, with a focus on actionable insights and practical relevance.

**Hybrid Intelligence in Development Environments**: Designing future collaboration paradigms between human developers and adaptive, assistive systems, ranging from conversational interfaces to agentic behavior.

**Learning from software histories at scale**: Using large-scale project data to uncover patterns, enable automation, and shape more intelligent development support systems, including issue report management, triage, and automated documentation.


### Industrial Collaborators/Funding
- **Amazon Research Award** (personal grant) on ["Understanding and Regulating Memorization in Large Language Models for Code"][amazon-award]
- Two fully-funded PhD positions funded by **JetBrains Research** through the AI4SE ICAI lab. Maliheh is leading two tracks; namely, [LLM adaptation for coding tasks][ai4se-track2] (track 2) and [Interactive and Aligned IDEs in the LLM Era][ai4se-track3] (track 3).

### Awards
