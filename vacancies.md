The TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group has the following vacancies: 

## PhD student in Software Testing and Validation for AI-intense Systems

The Ph.D. position will focus on the research and development of solutions to test and validate AI-intensive systems. AI-intensive systems involve multiple internal stages, pipelines, models, as well as interaction with other non-AI-based components. Often, they also process multimodal data requiring human interpretation. The question of quality assurance for AI thus is more refined than a single evaluation or testing approach, which often is seen today. In this Ph.D. project, we therefore will focus on bridging evaluation and testing methodologies from the software engineering and applied machine learning domains.

This project is a collaboration between the Multimedia Computing (MMC) Group at the Intelligent Systems (INSY) Department, and the Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) at the Software Technology (ST) Department. The INSY and ST departments closely work together in the facultyâ€™s Computer Science research and education.

## PhD student in Testing Distributed Systems

Modern computation increasingly depends on large-scale distributed systems and blockchains. However, these systems are difficult to design and implement correctly. They may fail to ensure correctness in subtle executions with unexpected orderings of exchanged messages, network partitions, and process failures.

The PhD project aims to develop program analysis and testing techniques for improving reliability of distributed systems and blockchains.

The project lies in the intersection of software testing, program analysis, and distributed systems. The prospective PhD student is expected to do high-quality research involving both theory and implementation: getting a deep understanding of theoretical abstractions of fault-tolerant systems and developing novel software analysis and testing techniques.
