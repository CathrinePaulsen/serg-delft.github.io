**Abstract**

This talk is about my recently accepted paper at CAIN 2024 colocated with ICSE 2024. I will present popular techniques to detect anomalies in operational data (AIOps data). I will further discuss about how the anomaly detection models need to be monitored and maintained over time to avoid performance degradation due to concept drift.
