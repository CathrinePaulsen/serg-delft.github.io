**Abstract**

This talk is about my paper which was recently accepted at AIware @ FSE'24, and won ACM Distinguished Paper Award. In the paper, I explore how to optimise AI-powered code completions by filtering out irrelevant and distracting suggestions. In the talk, I will briefly discuss the findings of the study, and lay out open research questions for improving this increasingly frequent interaction.
