**Abstract**

This talk is related to my Master's thesis and my research internship, which are about to end.
I will present some of the challenges that frequently arise when using search-based automated unit test generation tools on machine learning libraries in Python.
Then, I will talk about the solution I have implemented to solve these challenges based on a tool named Pynguin and on grammar-based fuzzing techniques.
Finally, I'll compare the performance of my solution with the performance of the original tool.
