**Abstract**

After their research visits to Hamburg and Melbourne last fall, Caro and Mark will reflect on the non-obvious impacts of their research visits during this talk.
We will explain what we learned about the areas of requirements engineering and socio-technical grounded theory, as well as our more general discoveries about research work.
There will be time to discuss, so bring your questions and maybe some own non-obvious learnings from past visits to other research institutions!
