In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Sára Juhošová**, who is a PhD candidate from the Programming Languages group, will be giving her practice talk for ICPC on *Pinpointing the Learning Obstacles of an Interactive Theorem Prover*. You can find the abstract and pre-print for the paper [here](https://sarajuhosova.com/#work). She'll explain the motivation for and some basic concepts behind interactive theorem proving, demonstrate the difficulties that new users face when learning to use them, and discuss the implications these obstacles carry.

**Baris Ardic** will talk about the findings from a mapping study on the use of qualitative methods in software testing. The talk is going to be informative on the existing use of qualitative methods and will include tips on methodological refinement.

If you are interested to give a 15 min + 10 talk or host a 25 min discussion session in one of our next meetings, please contact Carolin Brandt via Mattermost or email.
