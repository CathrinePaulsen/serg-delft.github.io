In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Mark Swillus**, will present his recently completed look into the role of sentiment in testing, opinions of developers, and the question(s): “Why do developers (not) test?”. Software testing is crucial for ensuring software quality, but a lot of developers perceive it as a daunting, annoying or underappreciated task. A lot of research emphasizes the usefulness of testing strategies and technical solutions, less is known about why developers have strong sentiments about it. Mark investigated the lived experience of developers to shed more light onto this.

Mark will share what he has learned so far: That developers are not always annoyed by testing but also aspire to it; that there are concrete technical, social and organizational conditions that encourage or discourage developers to use testing methods, and what this all implies for software development in general.

**You?** 
The second spot is still free! If you have a complimentary (not too similar) topic you'd like to present in our seminar, please poke Caro!
