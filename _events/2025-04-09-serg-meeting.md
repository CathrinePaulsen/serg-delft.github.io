In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Mathieu Nassif** will present Casdoc, a new format for software documentation based on interactive code examples. With this project, they studied how developers interact with development artifacts to find the information they need when using third-party APIs. Mathieu will discuss this project within the context of an effort to improve knowledge exchange among developers and development artifacts.

Short bio: Mathieu is a software engineering researcher focusing on the human aspects of the discipline, particularly the exchange of knowledge among different groups of developers, typically via documentation. He completed his PhD in 2024 at McGill University with Prof. Martin Robillard, is now a visiting researcher at Universit√§t Hamburg, and will soon start as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of Canterbury.

**You?** 
The second spot is still free! If you have a complimentary (not too similar) topic you'd like to present in our seminar, please poke Caro!
