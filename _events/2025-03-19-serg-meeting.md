In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Jonathan Katzy** 
topic TBA

**Andreea Costea** 
Bio:  
Andreea recently joined TU Delft as an Assistant Professor in the Programming Languages group, focusing on program verification, automated programming, and program repair. Her technical interests revolve around what makes software trustworthy, while at the same time exploring ways to make education and work more fun.

Abstract:  
With the rise of LLMs in automatic programming, there is growing interest in ensuring the trustworthiness of their output. However, guaranteeing correctness is challenging, especially since detailed specifications of intended behavior are often missing. This talk explores how to bridge that gap by aligning LLM-generated code with automatically derived formal specifications (from natural language via LLMs) and tests. While this approach doesn’t offer absolute guarantees, it enhances trust by establishing conformance between programs, specifications, and tests—helping to uncover the likely intended behavior.
