In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Roham Koohestani** will talk about his paper on the IDE workshop at ICSE'25 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02491).
Recent advances in artificial intelligence have increased the overhead of running applications, particularly with the integration of intelligent features into tools like IDEs. This has led to increasingly complex systems, requiring more efficient methods to deliver powerful capabilities without demanding excessive hardware resources. Hyperdimensional computing offers a promising approach, enabling efficient and holistic representation of concepts to provide effective solutions. In his talk, Roham will go over what HDC can mean for the developer community.

**You?** 
The second spot is still free! If you have a complimentary (not too similar) topic you'd like to present in our seminar, please poke Caro!
