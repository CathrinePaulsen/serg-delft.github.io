In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Eileen Kapel** will introduce the AIOps model she has been developing with her colleagues at ING, which aims to prevent deployment-related IT issues. By evaluating the reliability of changes based on historical data of similar changes and subsequent incidents, the model proactively identifies potential threats before deployment. Eileen will share the journey of developing and refining this model, along with some tips on conducting research and working with AI in industry.

**Daniele Cipollone** will introduce himself and share his master thesis with us: "Automating the Detection of Code Vulnerabilities by Analyzing GitHub Issues" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05258).
