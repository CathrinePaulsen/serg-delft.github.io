In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Enrique Barba Roque**, who recently joined SERG as a PhD student, will introduce himself, talk a bit about his master thesis and the research he plans to pursue during his PhD.

**Berkay Gülcan** will present his tool DSTest, which he developer for generalized controlled concurrency testing of distributed systems.
