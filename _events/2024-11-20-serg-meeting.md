In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Asato Yamazaki** External visitor, talk content to be announced.

**Clinton Cao**, who is doing his PhD with Annibale Pannichella and Sicco Verwer, will talk about fresh results from their latest study. They propose a new search heuristic (MISH) that uses real-time automaton learning to guide the test case generation process within EvoMaster. MISH continuously learns an automation from a stream of log statements and uses the the automaton to define fitness for the test cases.
