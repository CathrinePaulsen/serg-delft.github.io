In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Yongcheng Huang** will present their group's project on the effectiveness of state-of-the-art code LLMs in generating comments for code across five languagesâ€”English, Dutch, Chinese, Greek, and Polish. They conducted both qualitative and quantitative analyses, identifying distinct error types and demonstrating that popular neural evaluation metrics often overestimate performance, especially in non-English contexts. By open-sourcing a dataset of 12,500 model-generated comments, their work lays the foundation for improving evaluation methods and promoting more inclusive, multilingual software development research.
