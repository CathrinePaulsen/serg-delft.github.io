In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Quentin Le Dilavrec** will present his research tool enabling the efficient temporal analysis of software histories.
The corresponding tool paper will be presented at MSR 2025, in the continuation of the awarded approach presented at ASE 2022.
The HyperAST notably enables the incremental computation of code metrics, but defining metrics was error prone and required recompilation.
This contribution aims to facilitate the definition of code metrics and analyses on the HyperAST
by providing a sandboxed scripting interface focussing on usability and robustness. [HyperAST tool paper](https://perso.eleves.ens-rennes.fr/people/quentin.le-dilavrec/preprint/HyperAST_tool_paper.pdf)

Quentin will also make a short demo of this tool through its GUI, and show some other features, 
notably on temporal analysis (presented at BENEVOL 2024).

**Carolin Brandt** will present her short paper for ICST 2025: ["Towards Refined Code Coverage: A New Predictive Problem in Software Testing"](https://carolin-brandt.de/works/brandt-icst25).
Together with Aurora Ram√≠rez, she explores whether we can use metrics and traditional machine learning to predict whether a code line is (not) covered by the test suite.
