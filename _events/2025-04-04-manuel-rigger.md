### Abstract

Ensuring the reliability of database systems is essential but challenging, given their increasing size and complexity. In this talk, I will present our past and ongoing work to tackle correctness and performance issues in database systems. Specifically, I will present practical approaches that we designed to automatically test relational database systems tackling the two core challenges, namely automatic input generation as well as result verification, that is, automatically constructing test oracles. Furthermore, I will present an approach and our vision to apply existing techniques at a large scale to robustify the plethora of existing data-centric systems. 



### Bio

Manuel Rigger is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, where he leads the Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies (TEST) Lab. His research focuses on improving important software systems, in particular, reliability aspects of data-centric systems, in which he and his lab have found more than 1,000 unique, previously unknown bugs, most of which have been fixed by the developers of these systems. Before joining NUS, Manuel was a postdoc at ETH Zurich, mentored by Zhendong Su. He completed his PhD at Johannes Kepler University Linz, mentored by Hanspeter Mössenböck.
