In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Ali Al-Kaswan** will talk about "Code Red! On the Harmfulness of Applying Off-the-shelf Large Language Models to Programming Tasks".  
Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks. This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse. In this talk, Ali will present his work on Harmfulness in Code Models.
He will present a framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain and show that there are significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness.

**You?** 
The second spot is still free! If you have a complimentary (not too similar) topic you'd like to present in our seminar, please poke Caro!
