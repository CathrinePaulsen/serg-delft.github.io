In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Ali Al-Kaswan** will talk about "Code Red! On the Harmfulness of Applying Off-the-shelf Large Language Models to Programming Tasks".  
Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks. This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse. In this talk, Ali will present his work on Harmfulness in Code Models.
He will present a framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain and show that there are significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness.

**Ali Khatami** will talk about "Enhancing Quality Assurance Awareness Through Analytics Dashboards". His research addresses the gap in developers' awareness of QA practices by introducing RepoInsights, a QA analytics dashboard. Through interviews with 14 software engineers, he examined how they perceive and interact with such a dashboard. By analyzing their thoughts, interactions, and feedback while using the tool, he investigated how it enables reflection on software project QA. The study resulted in recommendations for designing and improving future QA analytics tools to enable better QA reflection.
